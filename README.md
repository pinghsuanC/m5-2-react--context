# Workshop: Cookie Clicker

This workshop challenges you to build an **idle game**.

An idle game is a game that involves very little active gameplay, and mostly a lot of waiting around for resources to grow. The most famous example of an idle game is [cookie clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), so we'll create a simple clone of that game.

The game features a cookie that can be clicked; every click yields 1 cookie. You can use cookies to buy resources that purchase cookies automatically for you.

Here's a finished working demo:
